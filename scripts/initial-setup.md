## 3. Section: The Dual Crisis & The Solution
**Heading:** Why Floating Solar?

**Content Block:**
Utah and the Colorado River Basin face a water crisis. Traditional power generation requires land and water. Floating Photovoltaics (FPV) solves both:

*   **Water Conservation:** FPV reduces water evaporation by up to 70-85% by shielding the water surface [1].
*   **Increased Efficiency:** The cooling effect of the water boosts solar panel efficiency by 5-20% compared to ground-mounted systems [2].
*   **Land Preservation:** FPV utilizes existing reservoir surfaces, sparing valuable agricultural and urban land [3].

**Key Stat:** 1 Acre of FPV = ~4.6 Acre-Feet of Water Saved/Year [4].

## 4. Section: Technology & Engineering
**Layout:** Three-Column Feature Grid

### Card 1: The Modules
*   **Product:** Jinko Eagle® 72 G6B
*   **Specs:** 570-590 Watt N-Type Bifacial modules [5].
*   **Features:** Dual-glass construction for humidity protection and bifacial gain (capturing light reflected off the water) [6].

### Card 2: The Float System
*   **Structure:** Hydrelio aiR Optim or similar modular pontoon systems.
*   **Durability:** Designed to withstand high winds (>130 mph) and varying water levels [7].
*   **Design:** Modular design allows for easy assembly on banks and towing to the specific site [8].

### Card 3: Grid Integration
*   **Strategy:** Hybridization with existing infrastructure.
*   **Benefit:** Utilizing existing substations at hydropower dams or natural gas plants (e.g., Currant Creek or Vineyard) to firm capacity and reduce transmission costs [9], [10].

## 5. Section: Strategic Utah Sites (Interactive Map Concept)
**Heading:** Identifying High-Potential Reservoirs
**Intro:** We have analyzed key sites based on transmission proximity and water conservation potential.

### Priority Targets:

1.  **Mona Reservoir (Juab County)**
    *   **Potential:** ~300MW+ solar farm utilizing the reservoir surface [11].
    *   **Grid Access:** Proximity to the Clover Substation (major transmission hub) and Currant Creek Power Plant [12], [13].
    *   **Synergy:** Potential for hybrid operation with onsite thermal and battery storage [11].

2.  **Utah Lake (Vineyard/Mosida)**
    *   **Potential:** 1,000+ MW arrays [10].
    *   **Grid Access:** Co-location with the Vineyard natural gas plant and Still Mill substation (approx. 1,200 ft from shore) [14].
    *   **Impact:** Massive evaporation reduction and air quality improvement by offsetting fossil fuel generation [15].

3.  **Grantsville / Settlement Canyon**
    *   **Potential:** Smaller municipal application.
    *   **Grid Access:** Proximity to South Tooele substation (approx. 1,200 ft) [16].
    *   **Benefit:** Direct tie-in to local municipal supply.

4.  **Mountain Dell**
    *   **Opportunity:** Unique opportunity to prepare reservoir floor for anchoring during current dam repair/drainage [17].

## 6. Section: Economic & Community Impact
**Layout:** Banner with Icons

*   **24,419:** Man-made water bodies in the US suitable for FPV [18].
*   **10%:** Potential US energy generation if just 27% of suitable water bodies are utilized [18].
*   **$2 Million/MW:** Estimated capital cost for Utah FPV development (conservative estimate) [19].

**Narrative:** FPV offers a path to reduce algae blooms (improving water quality), generate clean revenue for municipalities, and protect local water shares [20], [21].
